    Sonic is able to tap into chaos energy to create his moveset. Additionally, he is able to tap into the chaos energy to control time and space around him, but this feat requires a chaos emerald to use this ability.

    and protect them.</p>
   
    <h2 class="center">The Many Forms of Sonic</h2>
    <ul class="custom-bullets">
        <h2><b>Super Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Super Sonic is one of the most classic transformations that Sonic has. Sonic must gather the seven Chaos Emeralds in order for him to transform. He use the positive energy of the Chaos Emeralds. 
            Once transformed nothing can stop him. He gains the feats of super strength, hyper speed, flight, invulnerability and perfect chaos abilities. The chaos abilities include Chaos Snap, Chaos Spear, and Chaos Control. 
            All of these would have increased range and potency. He now has red eyes and his fur now this golden color. However, this transformation requires rings to maintain, so if Sonic runs out of rings then goes back to his base form.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Dark Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Dark Sonic is a transformation that has only ever appeared once and that was in the show <i>Sonic X</i>. The same concept is applied with Dark Sonic similar to Super Sonic except Sonic use the negative energy
                of the Chaos Emeralds to transform. Once he transforms nothing can stop him from unleashing his wrath. He gains the same exact feats of Super Sonic however is blinded by rage and can't really control his actions. 
                He no longer has pupils and all you see is a black hedgehog with glowing white where his should be. The same ring limitation still applies here so if he runs out then he returns back to base form.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Darkspine Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">

                Prayers, Sadness, Rage, Hatred, Joy, Pleasure, and Wishes are abosrbed by the <i>Erazor Djinn</i> and becomes <i>Alf Layla wa-Layla</i>. The rings are then sent out and Sonic absorbs the three of the World Rings. Rage, Sadness and
                Hatred are absorbed and Sonic then becomes Darkspine Sonic. Darkspine Sonic has the feats of increased speed, strength, flight, and the ability to slow and speed time. This is known as <i>Time Break</i> and <i>Speed Break</i>.

        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Super Sonic 2 is the upgraded form to Super Sonic as this was an upgrade recieved from <i>Master King</i> after you completed his trial. Once you finished his trial, he gives Sonic the power to control his Cyber Corruption and now is able to use
                it as power. This power is only half of what Sonic can do with this power as the power never intended to bond with someone who isn't a <i>Koco</i>. Super Sonic 2 has upgraded feats to Super Sonic as he can do everything that Super Sonic can do but 
                even better. Super Sonic 2 now has blue eyes instead of the normal red and is surrounded with this aura of gold and cyber corruption. Similar to Super Sonic, this transformation requires rings to maintain so once out of ring then Sonic returns to base form.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Cyber Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Cyber Sonic is the full power of the upgrade recieved from <i>Master King</i>. Once Sonic is in his Super Sonic 2 state, he can unleash the full power of the cyber corruption at the risk of never being able to upgrade to this form again.
                Cyber Sonic has similar feats to Super Sonic 2 with the only differences being that he now has a greater power for all of his abilites. The once golden color of his fur is now a digital color of black and blue covering everything, his eyes now a grey color, 
                and now is glitching out because of the cyber corruption. Similar to Super Sonic, this transformation requires rings to maintain so once out of rings Sonic returns to base form.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Hyper Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Hyper Sonic is a transformation that exceeds the power of Super Sonic. In order for Sonic to transform into the Hyper form, Sonic needs to gather all seven of the <i>Super Emeralds</i>. The <i>Super Emeralds</i> are an upgraded form of the 
                Chaos Emeralds as they now intuned with the <i>Master Emerald</i>, which controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds, anyways once gathered, Sonic can go Hyper and have feats that far surpass any form mention prior. He has boosted Super Sonic strength,
                Super Sonic speed, Super Sonic flight, Super Sonic chaos abilites, and overall is one of the strongest forms now mentioned. Sonic is in this multicolor form that changes from one to another within a microsecond, his eyes now a green color, and is surrounded in this aura of
                white sparks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Ultra Sonic</b></h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>
                Ultra Sonic is a transformation only mention in the <i>Archie Comics</i> however just because it is in a different universe doesn't mean it does rival some of the other transformations as this transformation rivals the power of Hyper Sonic. In
                order for Sonic to transform into Ultra Sonic, he must absorb an abundance of <i>Power Rings</i> which are similar to rings but grant a boost of power to the user. Sonic has the same feats of Hyper Sonic however the power is boosted, so there is 
                boosted Hyper Sonic speed, strength, flight, chaos abilites, and this transformation is the strongest that Sonic has. Sonic may look like he is in base form however, he has rings going around him and this aura of black stars surrounding him.
