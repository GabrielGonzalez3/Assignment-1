    <h2>Remember</h2>
    <p>
        All things said are from either the game and the comics. The stengths are varied between games, comics, and the timeline so the strongest form is speculation with facts along with it. 
        Reminder that is just a fan being a fan and doing what he does for his favorite series. Besides from that, all of the knowledge of the powers and feats are from me either 
        playing the games or reading the comics.

   <h2>Archie Comics</h2>
    <p>
        The Archie Comics are no longer in production ever since a lawsuit and now instead of the Archie Comics there is the IDW Comics that are meant to tie
        into the games and not its own seperate universe as originally the Archie Comics were seperate from the games.
